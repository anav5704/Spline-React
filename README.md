![hero pagw](https://github.com/anav5704/Spline-React/blob/main/docs/spline-react.png)

This is just a simple hero section made with React JS and Spline 3d. It was my first go at 3d for the web and I liked it. The UI design on the right of the hero animates on load and rotates in response to the user's cursor.

## Technologies Used

- React JS 
- TailwindCSS
- Spline 3d
